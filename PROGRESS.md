# PROGRESS

Working repo: this one (`Smartomni-Tiktok-Simulator`). The SmartOmni platform repo is **reference only** (user instruction); SmartOmni-side work is written as requirement documents in `docs/smartomni-requirements/` and marked BLOCKED here. Nothing in `spec/00-overview.md` is ticked: reviewers tick.

## Outstanding
- Everything SmartOmni-side (see the BLOCKED column and `REPORT.md`): the Buyer -> simulator -> SmartOmni -> inventory chain is NOT demonstrated.
- Real AI and real TikTok were never exercised.
- `spec/00-overview.md` checkboxes: reviewers tick.
