# Support matrix

Generated from `contracts/manifest.json` (contract status) and the TikTok-router controllers (simulator implementation). **No operation is `supported`**: the official Partner Center pages (Common parameters, scopes, error codes, webhook payloads) were not readable, so every operation stays `unverified` or `unsupported`. "implemented" means the simulator serves the route with the official-OAS shape; it does NOT prove real TikTok behaviour.

31 HTTP operations implemented (2 more routes exist only to refuse explicitly) of 38 listed.

## Blocked or unsupported on purpose

- `auth.authorization_url`: unsupported (URL not in readable sources); the simulator uses its own consent page.
- `promotion.coupon_create`: unsupported and locked: no create route exists; coupons are created only through `/demo`.
- `return.rma_202604`: unsupported; it does not replace Search Returns.
- `cs.send_message` (202606): no schema snapshot; 202309 is implemented instead.
- Upload operations (`product.media_upload`, `product.file_upload`, `cs.image_upload`): multipart signing unverified; refused explicitly.
- SmartOmni-side items of phases 05-09: BLOCKED in this repo (see `docs/smartomni-requirements/`).
